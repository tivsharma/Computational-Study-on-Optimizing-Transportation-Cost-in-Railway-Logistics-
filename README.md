# Computational Study on Optimizing Transportation Cost in Railway Logistics

Bio: 
Research paper on optimizing food cost in railway logistics using the transportation model (Published under Registration Number,  L-152589/2024)

#Overview
This project presents a computational study aimed at optimizing the transportation of food platters in Indian railway logistics using operations research techniques. The study focuses on maximizing profits for railway catering services through cost-efficient allocation of resources.

#Objective: 
Analyze, formulate and maximizing the profit in food transportaion in Rail Logistics. 

#Tools used 
- Linear Programming Problem (Formulating Problem)
- **Microsoft Excel Solver** (Linear Programming)
- **Manual Optimiaztion Techiques** (Transporation Problem)

#Key Insights
- **Profit maximization** for food delivery across 4 railway platforms using a transportation model|
- Solved using **Excel Solver** with detailed step-by-step methodology|
- Achieved a daily **optimal profit of ₹3,04,450/-** for the catering provider|
- The solution is **scalable** and can be applied across different locations and cost structures|
- The paper uses **secondary data** and realistic assumptions to mirror real-world logistics conditions.

  #Data Summary
  | Platform | Veg Thali | Chinese | Biryani | South Indian | Supply |
|----------|-----------|---------|---------|---------------|--------|
| 1        | ₹73       | ₹120    | ₹63     | ₹85           | 625    |
| 2        | ₹76       | ₹125    | ₹70     | ₹90           | 730    |
| 3        | ₹85       | ₹135    | ₹85     | ₹105          | 895    |
| 4        | ₹90       | ₹150    | ₹90     | ₹120          | 750    |
| **Demand** | **550** | **750** | **900** | **800**       |        |

Total Supply = Total Demand = 3000

#Results
- Optimal Solution yiels max. profit: Rs. 3,04,450/-|
- Efficiency improved by balancing supply and demand across different platforms|
- Supports scaling with changing data inputs or real-time station demands.
